# Writeup

This one is possible to solve in multiple ways. You can either play the game manually until you win, or you can use other smart solutions to make your life easier. The intended way is to set up a program that will read the grid and always move towards the apple until it is done with the game.

A great writeup for this challenge can be found in [fluffyhake's writeup repo](https://github.com/fluffyhake/SiktCTF-2024/tree/main/Misc/snak) which even includes a video showing his program solving the challenge automatically.
