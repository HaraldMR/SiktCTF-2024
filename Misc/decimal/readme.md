# decimal
**WIP**
Somehow give ip adress in decimal form, ip leads to server which has flag.

## Flag
SiktCTF{ON3_DeciLIt3r_0F_IP_aDr3s5ES_Pl34Se}

## Writeup
Did you know that ipv4 adresses could be written in decimal form? Neither did i until recently. To solve this challenge, decrypt the string into plain numbers. put this into a web browser with http header and voila, flag.
