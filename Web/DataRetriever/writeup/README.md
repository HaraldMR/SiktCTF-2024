SNooping around at the page, we can see some references to trackers. There exists a protocoll you can send with most browsers called "Do not Track". This DNT request is sent to every site when you load them and some websites respect these requests. This page also "respects" your privacy, and all ads and social media buttons are removed when you add the DNT signal to your browser, displaying the flag in the process.
