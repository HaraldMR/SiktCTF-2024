The web page is php, and loads through ?page=home.php which should give the idea that the page can load other pages. Through trial and error you should realize that the page deliberately blocks the user from entering root directories by checking for a starting '/' and also removes '../' from the prompt. You can from this try to break these restrictions by doing ....//, so it removes the ../ in the middle and is left with ../, which is what we want. Doing this also reveals that the page does not check for lateral movement, so you can type as many ....// as needed until you reach root. A typical place to look first is /etc/passwd. The page loads, and at the bottom of the file we see a user "flaguser". Here we can guess that the flag is in the flagusers home directory. So looking at /....//....//....//....//....//home/flaguser/flag.txt we get the flag.
